## Issue delta reports

Find how many new reactions and comments each issue received each day:

```sql
.mode json
.output issue_deltas_daily.json

WITH
  issues AS (
    SELECT
      "date",
      repository || '#' || id  AS issue_id,
      title,
      reactions,
      comments,
      'https://github.com/' || repository || '/issues/' || id AS issue_url,
    FROM 'top_issues/flutter/flutter/*.jsonl'
  ),
  issue_deltas_daily AS (
    SELECT
      "date",
      issue_id,
      reactions - LAG(reactions) OVER (PARTITION BY issue_id ORDER BY date) AS new_reactions,
      comments - LAG(comments) OVER (PARTITION BY issue_id ORDER BY date) AS new_comments,
      title,
      issue_url,
    FROM issues
    ORDER BY "date" DESC, new_reactions DESC
  )
SELECT
  *
FROM issue_deltas_daily
WHERE new_reactions != 0
;
```

Find how many new reactions and comments each issue received each week:

```sql
.mode csv
.output issue_deltas_weekly.csv

WITH
  issues AS (
    SELECT
      "date",
      repository || '#' || id  AS issue_id,
      title,
      reactions,
      comments,
      'https://github.com/' || repository || '/issues/' || id AS issue_url,
    FROM 'top_issues/flutter/flutter/*.jsonl'
  ),
  issue_deltas_daily AS (
    SELECT
      "date",
      issue_id,
      reactions - LAG(reactions) OVER (PARTITION BY issue_id ORDER BY date) AS new_reactions,
      comments - LAG(comments) OVER (PARTITION BY issue_id ORDER BY date) AS new_comments,
      title,
      issue_url,
    FROM issues
    ORDER BY "date" DESC, new_reactions DESC
  )
SELECT
  date_trunc('yearweek', "date") AS "date",
  issue_id,
  SUM(new_reactions) AS new_reactions,
  SUM(new_comments) AS new_comments,
  title,
  issue_url
FROM issue_deltas_daily
WHERE new_reactions != 0 OR new_comments != 0
GROUP BY date_trunc('yearweek', "date"), issue_id, title, issue_url
ORDER BY "date" DESC, new_reactions DESC
;
```

Find the Flutter issues with the most reactions in the last 6 weeks:

```sql
.mode csv
.output issue_deltas_total.csv

SELECT
  repository || '#' || id  AS issue_id,
  any_value(title) AS title,
  min(date) AS start,
  max(date) AS end,
  max(reactions) AS total_reactions,
  max(comments) AS total_comments,
  max(reactions) - min(reactions) AS new_reactions,
  max(comments) - min(comments) AS new_comments,
  'https://github.com/' || repository || '/issues/' || id AS issue_url,
FROM 'top_issues/flutter/flutter/*.jsonl'
WHERE
  date_diff('day', "date", today()) <= 42
GROUP BY repository, issue_id, id
HAVING new_reactions > 0 OR new_comments > 0
ORDER BY new_reactions DESC
;
```

Find the desktop issues with the most reactions in the last 6 weeks:

```sql

    SELECT * FROM top_issues WHERE date IN (
      SELECT date FROM top_issues ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 1
    )
  ),
  desktop_issues AS (
    SELECT issue_id FROM latest_issues WHERE list_contains(labels, 'team-desktop')
